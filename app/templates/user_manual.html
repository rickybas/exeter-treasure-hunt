        <h2>Getting Started and Logging in</h2>
        <p>When a user first loads the landing page they can login in either as a Player, by scrolling down and clicking
            play, or as a admin by clicking "Admin WP". These will take you through to separate pages as can be seen in
            the Player and admin Manual sections. Using navigation you can also access a features page and an about
            page. At the footer of the page users can access the GDRP and privacy policies and how a manual on how to
            play the game.</p>

        <h2>Player Manual (See figure 1)</h2>
        <p>Once a user has entered in to the player area they will be able to log in with their given user name and
            password. After logging in the player will see their location on the map. Along the bottom tab the play can
            access their own cards, the leader board and the map. In the top right a player can reset their cards (wipe
            their current progress), they can request help by sending a message to the game master (admin), access card
            QR code scanner, log out and access user manual. When logging out game progress will be saved. Other players
            can also be seen with a blue dot on the map to encourage co-operation.</p>

        <h2>Playing (see figure 2,3 and 4)</h2>
        <p>In the cards section a player can see a list of all cards, based on the colour of the card image the player
            owns the card or not. If the image is blacked out then the card is not owned, if the image is coloured the
            the card it owned. Once a card has its questions answered correctly then the card changes to completed
            state. A player will card start with one card. A play can gain new cards by going to the location of the
            card and answering the question correctly, or trading with another player using a cards QR code. A player
            can scan another players QR code via the QR code scanner accessible via the navigation bar. QR codes for a
            card are only available once a player has correctly answered the question on the card and completed it.
            Players can view on cards they own. Players have a given time to complete as many cards as possible, which
            is set by the game master.</p>

        <p>The leaderboard can be used by a player to track all players progress and the map to see other players
            location.</p>

        <h2>Admin Manual (See figure 5)</h2>
        <p>The admin side is best accessed from a computer. Once the admin has logged they will see the admin dashboard.
            Here they can see many stats to related to the current game. An admin can download a report of the game with
            the generate report button in the top right. An admin can also response to player help requests by viewing
            the request and replying to the user via email. On the dashboard the admin can also pause the game, reset
            location data and reset request data. To access requests the admin can click the help quests tab on admin
            dashboard. Along the left there is a navigation bar. The admin can navigate to the map where a heat map of
            where players are located is displayed. The Players tab allows the admin to see a list of all players and
            the players game details.</p>
