        <h2>Getting Started and Logging in</h2>
        <p>When a user first loads the landing page they can login in either as a Player, by clicking play, or as a
            admin by clicking "Staff Login". These will take you through to separate pages as can be seen in the Player and
            Admin manual sections. Below the logins you can see key features of the app. In the top left you can access a
            FAQ for help and click to display our GDPR and privacy policies.</p>

        <h2>Player Manual</h2>
        <p>A player will be shown around the app during their first play session by our ExePlore bot.</p>

        <p>A user will be able to log in with their given user name and
            password as received in their email. After logging in the player will see their location on the map. Along the bottom tab the player can
            access their own cards, the leaderboards and the map. In the top right a player can reset their cards (wipe
            their current progress), they can request help by sending a message to the game master (staff member), or they can
            log out. When logging out game progress will be saved.</p>

        <h2>Playing</h2>
        <p>A player can see a list of all cards, based on the colour of the card (green is if they have the card, gray if they do not, COMPLETE if they answer correctly). A
            player will card start with a few cards. A play can gain new cards by going to the location of the card and
            answering the question correctly, or trading with another player using a card's QR code. A player can scan
            another players QR code via the QR code scanner page accessible through the navbar. A player has a given time to complete as many cards as
            possible, which is set by the game master.</p>

        <p>The leaderboard can be used by a player to track all players progress and the map to see other players
            location.</p>

        <h2>Admin Manual</h2>
        <p>The admin side is best accessed from a computer, but is fully mobile compatible. Once the admin has logged they can will see the admin
            dashboard. Here they can see many stats to related to the current game. An admin can download a report of
            the game with the generate report button in the top right. Along the left there is a navigation bar. The
            admin can navigate to the map where a heat map of where players are located is displayed. The Players tab
            allows the admin to see a list of all players and the players game details. An admin can also respond to
            player help requests by viewing the request and replying.</p>
